  title: Welcome to my blog!
  description: >
    This blog is home to some of my favorite thoughts, mainly including opinions 
    on technology (mainly software), opinions on politics and the state, opinions 
    on theology, and opinions on opinions. If you're easily offended, go back to 
    Facebook or something, idk.

  I am a Computer Science major, a Hoppean Libertarian, and a Christian Radical. 
  
  In the world of technology, I'm a strong supporter of open-source and distributed 
  technologies, because I believe them to be more secure, more censorship-resistant, 
  and more privacy-respecting.

  In the world of politics, I'm a Hoppean Libertarian, otherwise known as an 
  anarcho-capitalist. I believe people should associate strictly on a voluntary 
  basis, and thus I'm opposed to the state, a force in modern society that exists 
  by involuntarily exploiting the people and regularly committing violent acts 
  against them. I'm also a believer that this position is further supported by 
  Scripture (see 1 Samuel 8).

  On the topic of Scripture, I'm a Christian Radical. Don't worry, I'm not 
  affiliated with Westboro, or any specific church, in fact. I would put myself 
  under the category of "Reformed".
